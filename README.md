The fundamental objective of this research endeavor is to meticulously orchestrate the repositioning of a camera by leveraging an absolute arm, thereby ensuring precise localization of the camera within the global coordinate system. This endeavor is prompted by the observation of an inherent and consequential error arising during the translation of input commands into actual camera movements. To meticulously address this pivotal issue, a sophisticated MATLAB-based approach rooted in serial kinematics is meticulously employed to estimate and rectify the positioning error. This multi-faceted pursuit encompasses the development, implementation, and rigorous testing of sophisticated algorithms, harnessing real-time data acquired through a goniometer. The culminating validation process is meticulously intertwined with the execution of a comprehensive measurement setup, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the experimental outcomes.
