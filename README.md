# Positioning-Error-of-6-DOFs-Goniometer
The aim of the work is initially to move the camera into different positions and with the help of absolute arm, the camera position in the world coordinate system can be measured. There is an error in the movement of the camera for the input command to the actual camera movement. This positioning error is estimated by using Robotic System Toolbox with serial kinematics approach. Algorithms are developed, implemented and tested based on real time data measured by the goniometer and validated while running the complete measurement setup.
