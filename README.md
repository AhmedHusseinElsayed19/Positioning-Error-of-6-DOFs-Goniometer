# 🎯 Camera Repositioning with Absolute Arm Using Serial Kinematics

## 📌 Objective
Precisely reposition a camera using an **absolute arm**, ensuring accurate localization within a global coordinate system. The goal is to correct errors caused by discrepancies between input commands and actual camera movement.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
A significant error arises during the translation of command inputs into real camera positions. This project aims to identify, model, and correct this positioning error.

## 🧠 Approach
- **Kinematic Modeling in MATLAB**: Utilized serial kinematics to analyze and rectify positioning inaccuracies.
- **Error Correction Algorithms**: Developed to correct deviations using real-time data.
- **Sensor Integration**: Employed a goniometer for precise angle measurements.
- **Experimental Validation**: Constructed a custom measurement setup to validate the results.

## 🧪 Outcome
- Improved reliability and precision of the camera positioning.
- Demonstrated accurate serial kinematics-based error correction using MATLAB.
- Validated the workflow through experimental trials.
